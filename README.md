I have a friend who's passionate about the Italian lottery. From time to time he comes up with some weird strategy. And I write a script that simulates playing following my friend's strategy, and of course the results aren't nice. 
I decided to cellect these scripts in a repo. Maybe I can show him how much I worked, and if he wins, he'll share with me.
